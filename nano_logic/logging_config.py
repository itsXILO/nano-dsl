"""Central logging configuration for nano-dsl's daemon and dashboard processes.

The daemon runs fully detached from a terminal (stdio redirected to
DEVNULL by the process that spawns it), and the dashboard is a Textual
TUI that owns the whole screen — neither has anywhere to print
diagnostics a user would ever see. Previously, failures in these paths
were caught and silently discarded (`except Exception: pass`), so a
disk-full, a permissions error, or a corrupted rules.json produced no
observable signal at all. This gives every module a real logger that
writes to a file under the state directory instead.
