"""Single-instance locking for the background monitoring daemon.

Uses an flock()'d PID file so at most one daemon process can ever hold
the lock, even if multiple dashboard instances race to spawn one.
Process-list scanning (checking "is daemon.py already running?" before
spawning) is inherently check-then-act and can't be made atomic; an
flock() on a shared file is a kernel-arbitrated mutex and is.
